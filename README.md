# matlab-snake-game
An implementation of a snake game with MATLAB, useful for AI implementation of a snake game. 

How to use: 

Run file: mysnake.m 

Use the arrow keys to maneuver. 

Use the [Space] to increase the snake length. 

Use the [Esc] to quit. 

The implementation does not consider the 'always moving snake' feature. The snake will only move if you push one of the arrow keys. No fruits will appear. Length of the snake must be increased manually by pressing the [SPACE] key. This is due to the idea of making this as a platform for AI designing for a snake game problem.
