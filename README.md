# matlab-snake-game
An implementation of a snake game with MATLAB, useful for AI implementation 
of a snake game. 

 **How to use:** 
- Run file: mysnake.m 
- Use the arrow keys to maneuver. 
- Use the [Space] to increase the snake length. 
- Use the [Esc] to quit. 

No fruits for the snake to eat will appear such that its length will increase. 
The length of the snake must be increased manually by pressing the [SPACE] 
key. The reason for this is due to the idea of making this as a platform 
for AI designing for a snake game problem.
